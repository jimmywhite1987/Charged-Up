Introduction: We decided to pick a subject of a current trend, owning an EV. With the world shifting
towards a more sustainable and environmentally friendly way of living we wanted to do a breakdown of how 
practical owning an electric vehicle would be with infastructure supporting it today. We will discuss which 
vehicles are most efficient, have the most range, and areas that would most likely benefit you owning an 
electric vehicle.
